# Multi-Agent Regatta Reinforcement Learning

This project presents a 2D America's Cup match simulator developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course for the Master's degree in Computer Science at the Università di Bologna, utilizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to solve complex control problems in competitive regatta scenarios. 
By implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm within a Gymnasium and Petting Zoo framework, autonomous agents are trained to navigate a simplified match race environment.
